I feel I always have my ear to the ground for any new tech that's coming out, and those who know me will know that I am quite passionate about testing things and looking at how I can adopt them into my workflow/life.

I wanted to write out some predictions for 2025 in tech and then see how many of them come true. These are complete predictions and are most likely biased due to my own interests at this point in time. As you've most likely guessed, they are mostly focused on AI.

### Future of Personal Computing

The concept of personal computing is going to shift over the year. In the past, the term has been around basic ideas of computing individuality; customisation of your device (wallpaper, app icons, etc.). But in 2025, this feels outdated.

With AI-powered application development tools such as v0 from Vercel and Bolt from StackBlitz, the barrier for creating your user-specific applications is becoming lower.

An example of this I had recently was that I wanted to create a way to randomise home workouts. I have been getting into doing calisthenics exercises at home, but I wanted a way to have a completely randomised workout each time. So I entered a prompt into Bolt, and it created a fully functional application that would randomise my workouts.

I'm interested to see how products will start to utilise this concept, giving users the ability to create dashboard views that are completely customisable and personal to them.

### AI-Assisted Video Editing

There's been a lot of buzz recently around AI video generation, which takes a text prompt or an image to then create a full video. This is all exciting tech; however, I feel the real change will be when AI can start to automate certain tasks of a video editor.

AI-assisted video editing will allow users to simplify certain elements of the editing process. Simple things such as generating multiple thumbnails for a video or generating subtitles are already available. But the more advanced usages, such as auto colour corrections or cropping multiple dimensions for different social media platforms, will be where the real time-saving will be.

### Utilising Multi-modal Interfaces

Currently, the main way that users interact with AI applications is through text. This has definitely helped with the major adoption of AI by the general public. Being able to quite easily talk to an AI using a medium that we're all very familiar with has been a game changer.

However, AI models are becoming much more advanced and are able to process more complex information much faster. As such, I'm interested to see how we can start to utilise these multi-modal capabilities.

Voice is becoming quite popular (I've found myself prioritising it for asking questions to AI) as it's much faster than a user typing, but I still think there are more advancements that can be made.

### Summary

My predictions are heavily focused on AI. AI is still the main focus of the year as it's gaining so much funding and really changing the way we interact with technology.

I'm interested to see how many of these predictions come true -- if any.
